					Data Structures are a method of organizing and storing data
					in such a way that they can be accessed and manipulated
					efficiently. They define the relationship between the data
					and the operations that can be performed on the data. There
					are various kinds of data structures, each suited to
					different applications, with some being highly specialized
					for specific tasks.
					<br />
					Arrays are the simplest data structures, storing data
					elements based on a sequential, most commonly 0-based,
					index. Linked Lists store data with nodes that point to
					other nodes, creating a chain of elements. HashTables store
					data with key-value pairs, allowing for efficient data
					retrieval based on a unique key. Stacks, Queues, and Deques
					are abstract data types representing collections of elements
					with two major operations: adding an element to the end and
					removing an element from the beginning. Heaps are used in
					many famous algorithms, such as Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm for
					finding the shortest path in a graph, the heap sort sorting
					algorithm, and implementing priority queues.
					<br />
					Graphs are mathematical structures that represent pairwise
					relationships between objects, serving as a flow structure
					that illustrates the relationships between various objects.
					Trees are a type of graph used to represent hierarchical
					structures, consisting of nodes and edges connecting the
					nodes. A special kind of tree, called a binary tree, is
					employed in certain high-speed search algorithms.
					<br />
					Big O Notation is used in Computer Science to describe the
					performance or complexity of an algorithm. Big O
					specifically characterizes the worst-case scenario and can
					be used to describe the execution time required or the space
					used (e.g., in memory or on disk) by an algorithm.
